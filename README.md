#MediaBay API
##About
Part of my backend capstone project at Nashville Software School. This repository sets up the API for handling data requests from the client app for administrators. No client app has yet been written for customers.
##Changes and Notes
2016-06-20: built controller with basic CRUD for a new product

2016-06-20: Work in progress creating first controller. Encountered problems with project and Visual Studio not communicating correctly. Problem is believed to have originated when first migration ran and the DbContext had plural table names. Started new branch based off of WIP branch, deleted migrations, deleted database, corrected context names, rebuilt DB. Problem solved.

2016-06-16: created context, added dependencies, added keys to models and ran first migration

2016-06-16: installed Entity Framework

2016-06-16: created models

2016-06-16: nuked from orbit and restarted due to Visual Studio error not able to load a root file.

2016-06-14: originally created with models
